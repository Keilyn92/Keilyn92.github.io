I can remember growing up as a little girl an waiting on dial up. You had to have a great deal of patience while waiting on dial up. My mother would call me to come fix her computer, which usually was a quick fix and often times I would be up all night trying to fix the problem. I always knew I had a passion for computers, because I would stay up all night doing things and undoing things on computers for fun, But I always knew there was a different language inside of the huge world we call technology.

Life forced me into obtaining a career as a truck driver and I always wondered why I chose the profession! Next thing I knew, I was driving for 15 years. One day while at work, we were at stand still because the tablet we used wouldnt work. The program crashed and the company was forced at stand still. We waited all day for the IT guy to come in and when he finally did, our manager was very happy to see him. I saw the guy walk in and I thought instantly, If he can do this why cant I.

So I started doing my research, and found this school. I saw negative comments coming from people who have never attended this school. So now I have two missions here, One is to become a Software Engineer in a field I always had a passion for and two, to prove the negative people wrong!!
